Signnary is an innovative application that helps people with disabilities communicate more easily by translating BISINDO sign language gestures into text. It enables seamless conversation by recognizing sign language from camera captures and uploaded images. The app features advanced image processing to accurately interpret hand gestures and includes a comprehensive dictionary for reference. Signnary empowers users by bridging the communication gap and enhancing accessibility.

We have implemented several features in this application. These features include:

- Predict :
<br /> Users can Identify Hand Sign BISINDO simply by using a camera to snap a photo of BISINDO or upload the image.

- Dictionary :
<br /> Users can search and learn more about the BISINDO including words, sentences, and real world implementation.
